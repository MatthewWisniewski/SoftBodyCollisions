# SoftBodyCollisions
First attempt at learning c++ by implementing a soft body collision system, and a 2D raycaster.

The main method of the program is currently in need of an overhaul, as the raycaster simulation was hacked on top of the previous soft body collision code, simply to make use of the classes I'd already defined. As such, many remnants of the soft body collision simulation are merely commented out within that file.
